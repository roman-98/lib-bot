# **CORA-BOT**

This program is designed for students of Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. The task of this program is to search for books. The purpose of the development is to abandon the library's card catalog, which simplifies the search and speeds it up. The reader no longer needs to rummage through paper catalogs. All books are in the database of this program. The advantage of this solution is that you do not need to download a special program. Just open Telegram, find the bot and start searching.
